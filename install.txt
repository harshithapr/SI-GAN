Sound Preprocessing Installation

sudo apt-get install libsamplerate0 libsamplerate0-dev
This python package will probably be the most tricky to install. If you are lucky, you can just

pip install scikits.samplerate
On my Ubuntu 12.04, this results in an error because the SRC library path is not found. The reason is that the setup searches SRC in /usr/lib and not in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu where the library is actually present. To install, you need to download the archive from pypi and edit some configuration file:

wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/scikits.samplerate/scikits.samplerate-0.3.3.tar.gz#md5=96c8d8ba3aa95a9db15994f78792efb4
tar -xvf scikits.samplerate-0.3.3.tar.gz
cd scikits.samplerate-0.3.3
then edit the site.cfg example file and insert the following lines:

[samplerate]
library_dirs=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
include_dirs=/usr/include
To know where the SRC library is on you machine:

sudo dpkg -L libsamplerate0
sudo dpkg -L libsamplerate0-dev
then, build and install:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install
